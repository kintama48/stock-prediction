## 📊 TensorBoard Metrics Dashboard

**Access**: http://localhost:6006 (already running)

### Key Metrics Logged:
1. **Loss Curves**
   - Actor/Critic/Total loss per training step
   - Entropy for exploration tracking
   - Learning rate schedule

2. **Episode Performance**
   - Total returns (most important for profitability)
   - Sharpe ratios (risk-adjusted performance)
   - Max drawdowns, win rates, trade counts

3. **Portfolio Metrics**
   - Final balance progression
   - Profit/loss per episode
   - Position sizing behavior

4. **Training Dynamics**
   - Advantage estimates distribution
   - Value function accuracy
   - Policy gradient norms

## 🎯 Smart Early Stopping Logic

**For Hyperparameter Optimization ONLY** (not profitable models):

```python
# Curve fitting approach
loss_curve = fit_exponential_decay(validation_losses)
sharpe_curve = fit_logarithmic_growth(sharpe_ratios)

# Predict final performance
predicted_final_sharpe = extrapolate(sharpe_curve, future_episodes)

# Stop if unlikely to succeed
if predicted_final_sharpe < 0.5 and no_improvement_for_patience:
    stop_trial()  # Save compute for better hyperparams
```

**Important**: Good models train longer until profitable!

## 🏃 How to Run

### Option 1: Production Training (Recommended)
```bash
cd training
python train_production.py  # Trains until Sharpe > 1.0, Return > 5%
```

### Option 2: Smart Hyperparameter Optimization
```bash
cd training
python hyperparameter_optimization_smart.py  # Finds best config
```

### Option 3: Advanced Training
```bash
cd training
python train_advanced.py  # Standard advanced training
```

### Monitor Progress
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=traininglogs  # Already running on port 6006
```
