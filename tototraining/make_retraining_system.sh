echo "Starting Toto model retraining system setup..."

# Step 1: Setup project structure and dataloader for OHLC training data
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p 'You are working in the tototraining/ directory. Create a comprehensive dataloader system for training the Toto model on OHLC stock data. Requirements: 1) Create toto_ohlc_dataloader.py that can load training data from trainingdata/train/ and validation data from trainingdata/test/ (last 30 days) 2) The dataloader should handle OHLC timeseries data and prepare it in the format expected by the Toto transformer model 3) Include proper data preprocessing, normalization, and batching 4) Add configuration management for hyperparameters 5) Support for multiple stock symbols and cross-validation. Make sure to analyze the existing Toto model architecture to understand the expected input format.'

# Step 2: Setup comprehensive logging and monitoring infrastructure
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p 'In tototraining/, create a robust logging and monitoring system for the Toto retraining pipeline. Requirements: 1) Create training_logger.py with structured logging for training metrics, loss curves, validation scores, and system metrics 2) Setup tensorboard integration for real-time monitoring of loss, accuracy, gradients, and model weights 3) Create experiment tracking with MLflow or similar to track hyperparameters and results across runs 4) Add model checkpoint management with automatic saving of best models 5) Include early stopping and learning rate scheduling logging 6) Create dashboard configs for monitoring training progress. Ensure all logging is production-ready and can handle long training runs.'

# Step 3: Implement comprehensive testing suite
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p 'Create a complete testing framework for the Toto retraining system in tototraining/. Requirements: 1) Create test_toto_trainer.py with unit tests for dataloader, model initialization, forward/backward passes, and loss computation 2) Add integration tests that verify end-to-end training pipeline with small synthetic data 3) Create test_data_quality.py to validate training data integrity, distribution, and preprocessing 4) Add performance tests to ensure training efficiency and memory usage 5) Create test fixtures and mocking for reliable testing 6) Include regression tests to ensure model outputs are consistent 7) Setup pytest configuration and test discovery. All tests should be fast and reliable for CI/CD integration.'

# Step 4: Create the main training pipeline
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p 'Implement the core training pipeline in tototraining/toto_trainer.py. Requirements: 1) Create a TotoTrainer class that handles model initialization, training loops, validation, and checkpointing 2) Implement distributed training support for multi-GPU setups 3) Add gradient clipping, mixed precision training, and memory optimization 4) Include proper error handling and recovery mechanisms 5) Support for resuming training from checkpoints 6) Implement learning rate scheduling and optimization strategies 7) Add validation metrics computation and model evaluation 8) Create configuration management for different training scenarios 9) Ensure the trainer works with the existing Datadog Toto model architecture and can retrain on OHLC data.'

# Step 5: Run initial training experiments and analyze results
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p 'Execute initial training runs to validate the retraining system in tototraining/. Requirements: 1) Run a small-scale training experiment with a subset of OHLC data to verify the pipeline works 2) Monitor loss curves, validation metrics, and training stability 3) Create analysis scripts to evaluate model performance on held-out test data 4) Generate training reports with loss plots, learning curves, and performance metrics 5) Identify any issues with data preprocessing, model convergence, or training stability 6) Document initial findings and recommendations for hyperparameter tuning 7) Save baseline model checkpoints and performance benchmarks. Focus on ensuring the training pipeline is stable before scaling up.'

# Step 6: Implement hyperparameter sweep system
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p 'Create an advanced hyperparameter optimization system in tototraining/. Requirements: 1) Implement sweep_config.py with Optuna or similar for automated hyperparameter tuning 2) Define search spaces for learning rate, batch size, model architecture parameters, dropout rates, and regularization 3) Create parallel sweep execution with distributed trials 4) Add early termination strategies for poorly performing trials 5) Implement multi-objective optimization for balancing accuracy vs. training time 6) Create sweep analysis tools to visualize parameter importance and trial results 7) Add automated best model selection and ensemble creation 8) Include budget management and resource allocation for large-scale sweeps. The system should systematically explore hyperparameter space to find optimal configurations.'

# Step 7: Run comprehensive evaluation and testing
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p 'Execute large-scale evaluation of the retrained Toto models in tototraining/. Requirements: 1) Run comprehensive testing on all available OHLC validation data (last 30 days) across all stock symbols 2) Implement evaluation metrics specific to time series forecasting: MSE, MAE, MAPE, directional accuracy, and Sharpe ratio 3) Create performance comparison between baseline and retrained models 4) Generate detailed evaluation reports with statistical significance testing 5) Perform robustness testing across different market conditions and volatility periods 6) Create visualization dashboards for model performance analysis 7) Implement A/B testing framework for production deployment readiness 8) Generate final model selection recommendations with confidence intervals and risk assessments. Ensure thorough validation before production deployment.'

# Step 8: Model packaging and deployment preparation
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p 'Prepare the best retrained Toto models for production deployment in tototraining/. Requirements: 1) Create model_packaging.py to save top-k models with proper versioning and metadata 2) Implement model validation pipeline to ensure production readiness 3) Create deployment artifacts including model weights, configuration files, and preprocessing pipelines 4) Add model serving interface compatible with existing inference systems 5) Implement model performance monitoring and drift detection 6) Create rollback mechanisms and A/B testing infrastructure 7) Generate comprehensive documentation for model deployment and maintenance 8) Package models in standard formats (ONNX, TorchScript) for optimal inference performance. Ensure smooth transition from training to production.'
